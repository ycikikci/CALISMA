Reasons for sampling
Sampling is an important technique in your statistical arsenal. It isn't always appropriate though—you need to know when to use it and when to work with the whole dataset.

Which of the following is not a good scenario to use sampling?

**You've been handed one terabyte of data about error logs for your company's device.

Simple sampling with pandas
Throughout this chapter, you'll be exploring song data from Spotify. Each row of this population dataset represents a song, and there are over 40,000 rows. Columns include the song name, the artists who performed it, the release year, and attributes of the song like its duration, tempo, and danceability. You'll start by looking at the durations.

Your first task is to sample the Spotify dataset and compare the mean duration of the population with the sample.

spotify_population is available and pandas is loaded as pd.

Sample 1000 rows from spotify_population, assigning to spotify_sample.

# Sample 1000 rows from spotify_population
spotify_sample = (spotify_population).sample(n=1000)

# Print the sample
print(spotify_sample)

Simple sampling and calculating with NumPy
You can also use numpy to calculate parameters or statistics from a list or pandas Series.

You'll be turning it up to eleven and looking at the loudness property of each song.

spotify_population is available and numpy is loaded as np.

Create a pandas Series, loudness_pop, by subsetting the loudness column from spotify_population.
Sample loudness_pop to get 100 random values, assigning to loudness_samp

# Create a pandas Series from the loudness column of spotify_population
loudness_pop = spotify_population['loudness']

# Sample 100 values of loudness_pop
loudness_samp = loudness_pop.sample(n=100)

print(loudness_samp)

Are findings from the sample generalizable?
You just saw how convenience sampling—collecting data using the easiest method—can result in samples that aren't representative of the population. Equivalently, this means findings from the sample are not generalizable to the population. Visualizing the distributions of the population and the sample can help determine whether or not the sample is representative of the population.

The Spotify dataset contains an acousticness column, which is a confidence measure from zero to one of whether the track was made with instruments that aren't plugged in. You'll compare the acousticness distribution of the total population of songs with a sample of those songs.

spotify_population and spotify_mysterious_sample are available; pandas as pd, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and numpy as np are loaded.

Plot a histogram of the acousticness from spotify_population with bins of width 0.01 from 0 to 1 using pandas .hist().

# Visualize the distribution of acousticness with a histogram
spotify_population['acousticness'].hist(bins=np.arange(0, 1.01, 0.01))
plt.show()

Are these findings generalizable?
Let's look at another sample to see if it is representative of the population. This time, you'll look at the duration_minutes column of the Spotify dataset, which contains the length of the song in minutes.

spotify_population and spotify_mysterious_sample2 are available; pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and numpy are loaded using their standard aliases.

Plot a histogram of duration_minutes from spotify_population with bins of width 0.5 from 0 to 15 using pandas .hist().

# Visualize the distribution of duration_minutes as a histogram
spotify_population['duration_minutes'].hist(bins=np.arange(0, 15.5, 0.5))
plt.show()

Generating random numbers
You've used .sample() to generate pseudo-random numbers from a set of values in a DataFrame. A related task is to generate random numbers that follow a statistical distribution, like the uniform distribution or the normal distribution.

Each random number generation function has distribution-specific arguments and an argument for specifying the number of random numbers to generate.

matplotlib.pyplot is loaded as plt, and numpy is loaded as np.

Generate 5000 numbers from a uniform distribution, setting the parameters low to -3 and high to 3.

# Generate random numbers from a Uniform(-3, 3)
uniforms =np.random.uniform(low=-3, high=3, size=5000)

# Print uniforms
print(uniforms)

Understanding random seeds
While random numbers are important for many analyses, they create a problem: the results you get can vary slightly. This can cause awkward conversations with your boss when your script for calculating the sales forecast gives different answers each time.

Setting the seed for numpy's random number generator helps avoid such problems by making the random number generation reproducible.

Which statement about x and y is true?

import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)
x = np.random.normal(size=5)
y = np.random.normal(size=5)

**The values of x are different from those of y.
