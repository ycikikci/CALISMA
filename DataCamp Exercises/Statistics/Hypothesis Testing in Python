Uses of A/B testing
In the video, you saw how Electronic Arts used A/B testing on their website when launching SimCity 5. One version of the page showed an advertisement for a discount, and one version did not. Half the users saw one version of the page, and the other half saw the second version of the page.

What is the main reason to use an A/B test?

It lets users vote on their preferred web page.

Calculating the sample mean
The late_shipments dataset contains supply chain data on the delivery of medical supplies. Each row represents one delivery of a part. The late columns denotes whether or not the part was delivered late. A value of "Yes" means that the part was delivered late, and a value of "No" means the part was delivered on time.

You'll begin your analysis by calculating a point estimate (or sample statistic), namely the proportion of late shipments.

In pandas, a value's proportion in a categorical DataFrame column can be quickly calculated using the syntax:

prop = (df['col'] == val).mean()
late_shipments is available, and pandas is loaded as pd.
Print the late_shipments dataset.

# Print the late_shipments dataset
print(late_shipments)

Calculating a z-score
Since variables have arbitrary ranges and units, we need to standardize them. For example, a hypothesis test that gave different answers if the variables were in Euros instead of US dollars would be of little value. Standardization avoids that.

One standardized value of interest in a hypothesis test is called a z-score. To calculate it, you need three numbers: the sample statistic (point estimate), the hypothesized statistic, and the standard error of the statistic (estimated from the bootstrap distribution).

The sample statistic is available as late_prop_samp.

late_shipments_boot_distn is a bootstrap distribution of the proportion of late shipments, available as a list.

pandas and numpy are loaded with their usual aliases.

Hypothesize that the proportion of late shipments is 6%.
Calculate the standard error from the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution.
Calculate the z-score.

# Hypothesize that the proportion is 6%
late_prop_hyp = 0.06

# Calculate the standard error
std_error = np.std(late_shipments_boot_distn, ddof=1)

# Find z-score of late_prop_samp
z_score = (late_prop_samp - 0.06) / std_error

# Print z_score
print(z_score)

Criminal trials and hypothesis tests
In the video, you saw how hypothesis testing follows a similar process to criminal trials.

Which of the following correctly matches up a criminal trial with properties of a hypothesis test?

Just as with criminal trials, there are more than two possible results at the conclusion of a hypothesis test.

Calculating p-values
In order to determine whether to choose the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis, you need to calculate a p-value from the z-score.

You'll now return to the late shipments dataset and the proportion of late shipments.

The null hypothesis, 
, is that the proportion of late shipments is six percent.

The alternative hypothesis, 
, is that the proportion of late shipments is greater than six percent.

The observed sample statistic, late_prop_samp, the hypothesized value, late_prop_hyp (6%), and the bootstrap standard error, std_error are available. norm from scipy.stats has also been loaded without an alias.

Right-tailed

Decisions from p-values
The p-value, denoted here as 
, is a measure of the amount of evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not. By comparing the p-value to the significance level, 
, you can make a decision about which hypothesis to support.

Which of the following is the correct conclusion from the decision rule for a significance level 
?


If the p<=a, reject Ha.

Calculating a confidence interval
If you give a single estimate of a sample statistic, you are bound to be wrong by some amount. For example, the hypothesized proportion of late shipments was 6%. Even if evidence suggests the null hypothesis that the proportion of late shipments is equal to this, for any new sample of shipments, the proportion is likely to be a little different due to sampling variability. Consequently, it's a good idea to state a confidence interval. That is, you say, "we are 95% 'confident' that the proportion of late shipments is between A and B" (for some value of A and B).

Sampling in Python demonstrated two methods for calculating confidence intervals. Here, you'll use quantiles of the bootstrap distribution to calculate the confidence interval.

late_prop_samp and late_shipments_boot_distn are available; pandas and numpy are loaded with their usual aliases.

Calculate a 95% confidence interval from late_shipments_boot_distn using the quantile method, labeling the lower and upper intervals lower and upper.

# Calculate 95% confidence interval using quantile method
lower = np.quantile(late_shipments_boot_distn, 0.025)
upper = np.quantile(late_shipments_boot_distn, 0.975)
# Print the confidence interval
print((lower, upper))

Two sample mean test statistic
The hypothesis test for determining if there is a difference between the means of two populations uses a different type of test statistic to the z-scores you saw in Chapter 1. It's called "t", and it can be calculated from three values from each sample using this equation.

 
 
 

While trying to determine why some shipments are late, you may wonder if the weight of the shipments that were on time is less than the weight of the shipments that were late. The late_shipments dataset has been split into a "yes" group, where late == "Yes" and a "no" group where late == "No". The weight of the shipment is given in the weight_kilograms variable.

The sample means for the two groups are available as xbar_no and xbar_yes. The sample standard deviations are s_no and s_yes. The sample sizes are n_no and n_yes. numpy is also loaded as np.

Calculate the numerator of the 
 test statistic.
Calculate the denominator of the 
 test statistic.
Use those two numbers to calculate the 
 test statistic.

# Calculate the numerator of the test statistic
numerator = xbar_no - xbar_yes

# Calculate the denominator of the test statistic
denominator = np.sqrt(s_no ** 2 / n_no + s_yes ** 2 / n_yes)

# Calculate the test statistic
t_stat =numerator / denominator

# Print the test statistic
print(t_stat)

Why is t needed?
The process for calculating p-values is to start with the sample statistic, standardize it to get a test statistic, then transform it via a cumulative distribution function. In Chapter 1, that final transformation was denoted 
, and the CDF transformation used the (standard normal) z-distribution. In the last video, the test statistic was denoted 
, and the transformation used the t-distribution.

In which hypothesis testing scenario is a t-distribution needed instead of the z-distribution?

The t-distribution is just another name for the z-distribution, so they can be used interchangeably.

From t to p
Previously, you calculated the test statistic for the two-sample problem of whether the mean weight of shipments is smaller for shipments that weren't late (late == "No") compared to shipments that were late (late == "Yes"). In order to make decisions about it, you need to transform the test statistic with a cumulative distribution function to get a p-value.

Recall the hypotheses:

: The mean weight of shipments that weren't late is the same as the mean weight of shipments that were late.

: The mean weight of shipments that weren't late is less than the mean weight of shipments that were late.

The test statistic, t_stat, is available, as are the samples sizes for each group, n_no and n_yes. Use a significance level of alpha = 0.05.

t has also been imported from scipy.stats.

Left-tailed

Visualizing the difference
Before you start running hypothesis tests, it's a great idea to perform some exploratory data analysis; that is, calculating summary statistics and visualizing distributions.

Here, you'll look at the proportion of county-level votes for the Democratic candidate in 2012 and 2016, sample_dem_data. Since the counties are the same in both years, these samples are paired. The columns containing the samples are dem_percent_12 and dem_percent_16.

dem_votes_potus_12_16 is available as sample_dem_data. pandas and matplotlib.pyplot are loaded with their usual aliases.

Create a new diff column containing the percentage of votes for the democratic candidate in 2012 minus the percentage of votes for the democratic candidate in 2016.

# Calculate the differences from 2012 to 2016
sample_dem_data['diff'] = sample_dem_data['dem_percent_12']-sample_dem_data['dem_percent_16']

# Print sample_dem_data
print(sample_dem_data)

Using ttest()
Manually calculating test statistics and transforming them with a CDF to get a p-value is a lot of effort to compare two sample means. The comparison of two sample means is called a t-test, and the pingouin Python package has a .ttest() method to accomplish it. This method provides some flexibility in how you perform the test.

As in the previous exercise, you'll explore the difference between the proportion of county-level votes for the Democratic candidate in 2012 and 2016 to identify if the difference is significant. The hypotheses are as follows:

: The proportion of democratic votes in 2012 and 2016 were the same. 
: The proportion of democratic votes in 2012 and 2016 were different.

sample_dem_data is available and has the columns diff, dem_percent_12, and dem_percent_16 in addition to the state and county names. pingouin and has been loaded along with pandas as pd.

Conduct a t-test on the sample differences (the diff column of sample_dem_data), using an appropriate alternative hypothesis chosen from "two-sided", "less", and "greater".

# Conduct a t-test on diff
test_results = pingouin.ttest(x=sample_dem_data['diff'],y=0,alternative="two-sided")


                              
# Print the test results
print(test_results)

Visualizing many categories
So far in this chapter, we've only considered the case of differences in a numeric variable between two categories. Of course, many datasets contain more categories. Before you get to conducting tests on many categories, it's often helpful to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), calculating summary statistics for each group and visualizing the distributions of the numeric variable for each category using box plots.

Here, we'll return to the late shipments data, and how the price of each package (pack_price) varies between the three shipment modes (shipment_mode): "Air", "Air Charter", and "Ocean".

late_shipments is available; pandas and matplotlib.pyplot are loaded with their standard aliases, and seaborn is loaded as sns.

Group late_shipments by shipment_mode and calculate the mean pack_price for each group, storing the result in xbar_pack_by_mode.

# Calculate the mean pack_price for each shipment_mode
xbar_pack_by_mode = late_shipments.groupby("shipment_mode")['pack_price'].mean()

# Print the grouped means
print(xbar_pack_by_mode)

Conducting an ANOVA test
The box plots made it look like the distribution of pack price was different for each of the three shipment modes. However, it didn't tell us whether the mean pack price was different in each category. To determine that, we can use an ANOVA test. The null and alternative hypotheses can be written as follows.

: Pack prices for every category of shipment mode are the same.

: Pack prices for some categories of shipment mode are different.

Use a significance level of 0.1.

late_shipments is available and pingouin has been loaded.

Run an ANOVA on late_shipments investigating 'pack_price' (the dependent variable) between the groups of 'shipment_mode'.

# Run an ANOVA for pack_price across shipment_mode
anova_results = pingouin.anova(data=late_shipments, dv="pack_price", between="shipment_mode")



# Print anova_results
print(anova_results)

Pairwise t-tests
The ANOVA test didn't tell you which categories of shipment mode had significant differences in pack prices. To pinpoint which categories had differences, you could instead use pairwise t-tests.

late_shipments is available and pingouin has been loaded.

Perform pairwise t-tests on late_shipments's pack_price variable, grouped by shipment_mode, without doing any p-value adjustment.

# Perform a pairwise t-test on pack price, grouped by shipment mode
pairwise_results = pingouin.pairwise_tests(data=late_shipments,dv="pack_price",between="shipment_mode")




# Print pairwise_results
print(pairwise_results)

t for proportions?
Some of the hypothesis tests in this course have used a 
 test statistic and some have used a 
 test statistic. To get the correct p-value, you need to use the right type of test statistic.

Do tests of proportion(s) use a 
 or a 
 test statistic and why?

t: There are two estimates used for unknown values in the test statistic for proportion(s).

Test for single proportions
In Chapter 1, you calculated a p-value for a test hypothesizing that the proportion of late shipments was greater than 6%. In that chapter, you used a bootstrap distribution to estimate the standard error of the statistic. An alternative is to use an equation for the standard error based on the sample proportion, hypothesized proportion, and sample size.

 
 

You'll revisit the p-value using this simpler calculation.

late_shipments is available. pandas and numpy are available under their usual aliases, and norm is loaded from scipy.stats.

Hypothesize that the proportion of late shipments is 6%.
Calculate the sample proportion of shipments where late equals "Yes".
Calculate the number of observations in the sample.

# Hypothesize that the proportion of late shipments is 6%
p_0 = 0.06

# Calculate the sample proportion of late shipments
p_hat =(late_shipments['late']=="Yes").mean()

# Calculate the sample size
n = len(late_shipments)

# Print p_hat and n
print(p_hat,n)

Test of two proportions
You may wonder if the amount paid for freight affects whether or not the shipment was late. Recall that in the late_shipments dataset, whether or not the shipment was late is stored in the late column. Freight costs are stored in the freight_cost_group column, and the categories are "expensive" and "reasonable".

The hypotheses to test, with "late" corresponding to the proportion of late shipments for that group, are

: 

: 

p_hats contains the estimates of population proportions (sample proportions) for each freight_cost_group:

freight_cost_group  late
expensive           Yes     0.082569
reasonable          Yes     0.035165
Name: late, dtype: float64
ns contains the sample sizes for these groups:

freight_cost_group
expensive     545
reasonable    455
Name: late, dtype: int64
pandas and numpy have been imported under their usual aliases, and norm is available from scipy.stats.

Calculate the pooled sample proportion p, from p_hats and ns.

# Calculate the pooled estimate of the population proportion
p_hat = (ns["expensive"] * p_hats.loc[("expensive","Yes")] + ns["reasonable"] * p_hats.loc[("reasonable","Yes")]) / ( ns["expensive"] + ns["reasonable"] )
# Print the result
#print(p_hats.loc[("expensive","Yes")])
#print(ns["expensive"])
print(p_hat)

proportions_ztest() for two samples
That took a lot of effort to calculate the p-value, so while it is useful to see how the calculations work, it isn't practical to do in real-world analyses. For daily usage, it's better to use the statsmodels package.

Recall the hypotheses.

: 

: 

late_shipments is available, containing the freight_cost_group column. numpy and pandas have been loaded under their standard aliases, and proportions_ztest has been loaded from statsmodels.stats.proportion.

Get the counts of the late column grouped by freight_cost_group.

# Count the late column values for each freight_cost_group
late_by_freight_cost_group = late_shipments.groupby("freight_cost_group")["late"].value_counts()
# Print the counts
print(late_by_freight_cost_group)

How many tails for chi-square tests?
Unlike pingouin.ttest() and statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportions_ztest(), pingouin.chi2_independence() does not have an alternative argument to specify which tails are considered by the alternative hypothesis.

Which tail is almost always considered in chi-square tests?

Left-tailed

Performing a chi-square test
The chi-square independence test compares proportions of successes of one categorical variable across the categories of another categorical variable.

Trade deals often use a form of business shorthand in order to specify the exact details of their contract. These are International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) international commercial terms, or incoterms for short.

The late_shipments dataset includes a vendor_inco_term that describes the incoterms that applied to a given shipment. The choices are:

EXW: "Ex works". The buyer pays for transportation of the goods.
CIP: "Carriage and insurance paid to". The seller pays for freight and insurance until the goods board a ship.
DDP: "Delivered duty paid". The seller pays for transportation of the goods until they reach a destination port.
FCA: "Free carrier". The seller pays for transportation of the goods.
Perhaps the incoterms affect whether or not the freight costs are expensive. Test these hypotheses with a significance level of 0.01.

: vendor_inco_term and freight_cost_group are independent.

: vendor_inco_term and freight_cost_group are associated.

late_shipments is available, and the following have been loaded: matplotlib.pyplot as plt, pandas as pd, and pingouin.

Calculate the proportion of freight_cost_group in late_shipments grouped by vendor_inco_term.

# Proportion of freight_cost_group grouped by vendor_inco_term
props = late_shipments.groupby("vendor_inco_term")["freight_cost_group"].value_counts(normalize = True)

# Print props
print(props)
#print(late_shipments.groupby("vendor_inco_term"))

Visualizing goodness of fit
The chi-square goodness of fit test compares proportions of each level of a categorical variable to hypothesized values. Before running such a test, it can be helpful to visually compare the distribution in the sample to the hypothesized distribution.

Recall the vendor incoterms in the late_shipments dataset. You hypothesize that the four values occur with these frequencies in the population of shipments.

CIP: 0.05
DDP: 0.1
EXW: 0.75
FCA: 0.1
These frequencies are stored in the hypothesized DataFrame.

The incoterm_counts DataFrame stores the .value_counts() of the vendor_inco_term column.

late_shipments is available; pandas and matplotlib.pyplot are loaded with their standard aliases.

Find the total number of rows in late_shipments.

# Find the number of rows in late_shipments
n_total = len(late_shipments)

# Print n_total
print(n_total)

Performing a goodness of fit test
The bar plot of vendor_inco_term suggests that the distribution across the four categories was quite close to the hypothesized distribution. You'll need to perform a chi-square goodness of fit test to see whether the differences are statistically significant.

Recall the hypotheses for this type of test:

: The sample matches with the hypothesized distribution.

: The sample does not match with the hypothesized distribution.

To decide which hypothesis to choose, we'll set a significance level of 0.1.

late_shipments, incoterm_counts, and hypothesized from the last exercise are available. chisquare from scipy.stats has been loaded.

Using the incoterm_counts and hypothesized datasets, perform a chi-square goodness of fit test on the incoterm counts, n.

# Perform a goodness of fit test on the incoterm counts n
gof_test = chisquare(
    f_obs=incoterm_counts["n"],
    f_exp=hypothesized["n"]
)


# Print gof_test results
print(gof_test)

Common assumptions of hypothesis tests
Hypothesis tests make assumptions about the dataset that they are testing, and the conclusions you draw from the test results are only valid if those assumptions hold. While some assumptions differ between types of test, others are common to all hypothesis tests.

Which of the following statements is a common assumption of hypothesis tests?

Sample observations are collected deterministically from the population.

Testing sample size
In order to conduct a hypothesis test and be sure that the result is fair, a sample must meet three requirements: it is a random sample of the population, the observations are independent, and there are enough observations. Of these, only the last condition is easily testable with code.

The minimum sample size depends on the type of hypothesis tests you want to perform. You'll now test some scenarios on the late_shipments dataset.

Note that the .all() method from pandas can be used to check if all elements are true. For example, given a DataFrame df with numeric entries, you check to see if all its elements are less than 5, using (df < 5).all().

late_shipments is available, and pandas is loaded as pd.

print((counts >= 30).all())

Which parametric test?
Which test is a parametric equivalent to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test?


z-test for a difference in proportions

Wilcoxon signed-rank test
You'll explore the difference between the proportion of county-level votes for the Democratic candidate in 2012 and 2016 to identify if the difference is significant.

sample_dem_data is available, and has columns dem_percent_12 and dem_percent_16 in addition to state and county names. The following packages have also been loaded: pingouin and pandas as pd.

Conduct a paired t-test on the percentage columns using an appropriate alternative hypothesis.
Conduct a Wilcoxon-signed rank test on the same columns.

# Conduct a paired t-test on dem_percent_12 and dem_percent_16
paired_test_results = pingouin.ttest(x=sample_dem_data['dem_percent_12'],y=sample_dem_data['dem_percent_16'],paired=True,alternative="two-sided")




# Print paired t-test results
print(paired_test_results)

Kruskal-Wallis
Recall that the Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric version of an ANOVA test, comparing the means across multiple groups.

late_shipments is available, and the following packages have been loaded: pingouin and pandas as pd.

Run a Kruskal-Wallis test on weight_kilograms between the different shipment modes in late_shipments.

# Run a Kruskal-Wallis test on weight_kilograms vs. shipment_mode

    dv = "weight_kilograms",
    between = "shipment_mode"
)



# Print the results
print(kw_test)
